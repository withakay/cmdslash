# Requirements: Example Feature

## Overview
This is an example feature to demonstrate the spec-driven workflow.

## User Stories

### Story 1: Basic Example
**As a** developer  
**I want** to see an example of the spec workflow  
**So that** I can understand how to use it

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. **GIVEN** a new project  
   **WHEN** I run /spec-status  
   **THEN** I see this example module

## Notes
- Delete this example when you create your first real spec
- Use `/spec-create` to create new modules
